# SDM-workflow-CASPIAN
Workflow to automatically fit species distribution models and predict environmental suitability for a focal species in a focal area. Can be linked with CASPIAN.

To run this workflow you need to have R installed on your computer. Having additionally installed RStudio would be beneficial. Proceed via opening the R project file 'SDMs'. Within the R project open the file 'run_SDM_workflow.R'. Start by running line 16 to 28 which will install and/or load all required R packages and create the output folder. 
Next, specify everything you need/ want to specify in line 34 to 56. After this step, you are ready to run the remainder of the script. Ideally proceed by one function at a time
so you will be able to see in the console how the progress is or whether something went wrong.
